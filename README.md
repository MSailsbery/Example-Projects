# Example-Projects
This repository is full of illustrative examples of skills that I have learned through my master's degree as well as those from other projects.
All the projects are organized in subfolders with any required files and a pdf file or jupyter notebook serving as a walkthrough of the project.

This repository will be filled up piece by piece throughout June and July 2020.
