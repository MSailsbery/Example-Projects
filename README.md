# Example-Projects
Thank you for checking out my repository!
In here, I upload projects that are examples of various coding, data science, and machine learning skills.

For end-to-end projects, I suggest looking at NLP - Will a Given Bill Pass the Senate or water_main_breaks_project.

For time series analysis and model verification, check out Time Series Prediction or FX-Aware Investing.

For a demonstration of SQL chops, check out relational_db_SQLite.

For machine learning theory and an example of DSC's one of the backbone's of EfficientNet, check out the PyTorch folder.

For interpretable learning, look at NLP - Will a Given Bill Pass the Senate.

This repository is still a work in progress, so check pack periodically for more examples!
